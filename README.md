# Skin_cancer_classification
Developed a skin cancer classification pipeline using MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 architectures, trained on a dataset of 3,000 grayscale dermoscopic images spanning 7 classes. The dataset exhibited a pronounced class imbalance, with class 6 being overrepresented, which initially led to a mild prediction bias toward majority classes. To mitigate this, Hard Data Mining techniques were employed—fine-tuning the models on misclassified and low-confidence samples—to improve generalization, especially on underrepresented classes. Achieved up to 73.8% validation accuracy. Performance evaluation through confusion matrices and class-wise F1-scores showed significant gains in handling edge cases and minority class predictions after hard mining.
